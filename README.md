## Background and Overview

Foreign exchange markets are crucial the functioning of national economies, as they allow businesses in one country to use their domestic currency and exchange it for a foreign currency, enabling cross-border trade. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can have significant impacts on national economies because their domestic currency's purchasing power becomes impacted, which affects import and export prices. These fluctuations are caused by a variety of factors, including inflation, interest rates, and political stability.  This project is meant to provide users with a better understanding of the forex market and how it works.
